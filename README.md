# Pixelc
An opensource tile/sprite editor in C, using SDL2 and OpenGL, also running on Android.

Based on [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some) framework.

Have a look at [Tilec](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Tilec) for a forked tile map editor.

## Live demo
Compiled with emscripten [live demo](https://renehorstmann.github.io/pixelc)
Lots of features are missing in the web demo! (Loading, Saving, options like size, ...)

## Status:
Ready to draw.
Saves after each tip on the screen to image.png.
Loads image.png at start, if available.
An import button can load import.png as selection, if available.
Palette, canvas size, animation size can be configured in code (main.c).

## Without Cmake

Instead of cmake, the following call to gcc may work, too.

```sh
mkdir build && cd build

cp -r ../res .

gcc ../src/e/*.c ../src/p/*.c ../src/r/*.c ../src/u/*.c ../src/*.c -I../include/ $(sdl2-config --cflags --libs) -lSDL2_image -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lglu32 -DOPTION_GLEW -DOPTION_SDL -o pixelc
```
