## Known Bugs
A few bugs that I haven't been able to solve yet:

### 1. Web Image Upload Zoom Bug
Zoomed in on your Browser while asked for an image upload?
try:
- use desktop version in your browser to reset the size
- empty the browser cache/data (for the Pixelc App)

If you know someone who speaks html better than me, tell me :)

Using the html option `user-scalable=no` will create a smaller canvas size on phones, which looks washed due to linear scaling. 
Also not all browsers disable zoom (like the Samsung Internet Browser)

### 2. Samsung Internet Browser App Corruption Bug
Using the tiling mode may create wrong rendering in the tilemap first (some tiles are just wrong or missing).
The more that happens, other parts of the App will break, too.
Often files cant be loaded anymore, so a lot of black rects will appear here and there...
Looks like a C memory overflow to me, but all other browsers and platform do not have that problem.
Also the Google Sanitizer on Ubuntu does not detect any leaks or overflows...

## Install and run on Desktop
Have a look at the section of [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some).


## Compiling for Web
Using Emscripten https://emscripten.org/
Tested under Ubuntu and WSL Ubuntu.
You should have already cloned the project and `cd` to that dir:

- Create a sub-directory to compile the website
```sh
mkdir web && cp index.html web && cp icon/* web && cd web
```

- Copy all resources, because emscripten may not be able to use `../res`
```sh
cp -r ../res .
```

- Compile
```sh
emcc -O3 \
-I../include/ \
-s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s FULL_ES3=1 -s \
EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS='["_main", "_e_io_idbfs_synced", "_e_io_file_upload_done"]' \
-s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=FS \
-s SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS='["png"]' \
--preload-file ./res \
-s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -s ASYNCIFY=1 -s EXIT_RUNTIME=1 \
-lidbfs.js \
-DPLATFORM_EMSCRIPTEN -DOPTION_GLES -DOPTION_SDL \
../src/e/*.c ../src/p/*.c ../src/r/*.c ../src/u/*.c ../src/*.c ../src/dialog/*.c ../src/tool/*.c \
-o index.js
```

- Test the website (open a browser and call localhost:8000)
```sh
python3 -m http.server --bind localhost  # [port]
```

## Todo
- palette info show "tileset 0" on startup
  - just disable it own startup...
- palette start color is wrong (tileset code?)
- change requirements of android to GLES3.1?
- android class call NULL checks
- premium/sponsor version
