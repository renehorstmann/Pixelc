## Web Image Upload Zoom Bug
Zoomed in on your Browser while asked for an image upload?
try:
- use desktop version in your browser to reset the size
- empty the browser cache/data (for the Pixelc App)

If you know someone who speaks html better than me, tell me :)

Using the html option `user-scalable=no` will create a smaller canvas size on phones, which looks washed due to linear scaling. 
Also not all browsers disable zoom (like the Samsung Internet Browser)

## Install and run on Desktop
Have a look at the section of [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some).


## Compiling for Web
Using Emscripten https://emscripten.org/
Tested under Ubuntu and WSL Ubuntu.
You should have already cloned the project and `cd` to that dir:

- Create a sub-directory to compile the website
```sh
mkdir web && cp index.html web && cp icon/* web && cd web
```

- Copy all resources, because emscripten may not be able to use `../res`
```sh
cp -r ../res .
```

- Compile
```sh
emcc -O3 \
-I../include/ \
-s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s FULL_ES3=1 -s \
EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS='["_main", "_e_io_idbfs_synced", "_e_io_file_upload_done"]' \
-s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=FS \
-s SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS='["png"]' \
--preload-file ./res \
-s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -s ASYNCIFY=1 -s EXIT_RUNTIME=1 \
-lidbfs.js \
-DPLATFORM_EMSCRIPTEN -DOPTION_GLES -DOPTION_SDL \
../src/e/*.c ../src/p/*.c ../src/r/*.c ../src/u/*.c ../src/*.c ../src/dialog/*.c ../src/tool/*.c \
-o index.js
```

- Test the website (open a browser and call localhost:8000)
```sh
python3 -m http.server --bind localhost  # [port]
```

## Mod
Pixelc has a little and stupid modding system.
Have a look at [mod.h](include/mod.h).

### Mod Tilec

![img](mod_tilec.png)

> Create tilesets for 2d games in a 2d or 3d isometric grid!

To use the **Tilec** Mod, set `MOD_TILEC true` in the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) configuration file.

Tilec loads up to 128 tilesheets from `tiles/tile_XX.png` in the working directory of Pixelc

To change the dir or the tile size, see [mod_tiles.h](src/mod/tilec/mod_tiles.h).

The 3d isometric renderer assumes that each layer is a z-layer.
So layer 1 is the bottom floor. 

Result of Tilec is an image .png file, in which each color is a code to the tile.
- Color code for transparency: `0, 0, 0, 0`
- Color code for a tile: `tile_file_id, x, y, 255`

> Currently not supported as App.
> If you want to use it directly on Android, 
> have a look at the install section of [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some) /CxxDroid
