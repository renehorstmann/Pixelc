# Pixelc
An opensource tile/sprite editor in C, using SDL2 and OpenGL, also running on Android.

Based on [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some) framework.

Have a look at [Tilec](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Tilec) for a forked tile map editor.

## Live demo
Compiled with emscripten [live demo](https://renehorstmann.github.io/pixelc)
Lots of features are missing in the web demo! (Loading, Saving, options like size, ...)

## Status:
Ready to draw.
Saves after each tip on the screen to image.png.
An import button can load import.png as selection, if available.
Palette, canvas size, animation size can be configured in code (main.c).

## Install and run on Desktop
Have a look at the section of [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some)


## Compiling for Web
Using Emscripten https://emscripten.org/
Tested under Ubuntu and WSL Ubuntu.
You should have already cloned the project and `cd` to that dir:

- Create a sub directory to compile the website
```sh
mkdir web && cp index.html web && cp icon/* web && cd web
```

- Copy all resources, because emscripten may not be able to use `../res`
```sh
cp -r ../res .
```

- Compile
```sh
emcc -O3 \
-I../include/ \
-s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s FULL_ES3=1 -s \
EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS='["_main", "_e_io_idbfs_synced", "_e_io_file_upload_done"]' \
-s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=FS \
-s SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS='["png"]' \
--preload-file ./res \
-s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -s ASYNCIFY=1 -s EXIT_RUNTIME=1  \
-lidbfs.js \
-DOPTION_GLES -DOPTION_SDL \
../src/e/*.c ../src/p/*.c ../src/r/*.c ../src/u/*.c ../src/*.c \
-o index.js
```

- Test the website (open a browser and call localhost:8000)
```sh
python3 -m http.server --bind localhost  # [port]
```
